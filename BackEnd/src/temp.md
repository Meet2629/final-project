❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely lead to an error or unexpected behavior as
the function will rely on variables from the outer scope (if they exist).
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, which limits its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it clear what values it needs to operate on.
* ✔️ By defining `a` and `b` as parameters, the function becomes self-contained and doesn't rely on external variables,
promoting better code organization and preventing potential naming conflicts or unexpected side effects.

Final Note:
Always define your variables within the scope they are used, and make your functions accept arguments to enhance
reusability and predictability.
